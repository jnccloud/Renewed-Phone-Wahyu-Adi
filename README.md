### README.md for Renewed Phone customized by Wahyu Adi ("4.0 INSPIRED")

#### GPL v3 Compliant Distribution Notification

Welcome to the repository for Renewed-Phone customized by Wahyu Adi. This document serves as an official notification and overview of the distribution of this software, which includes modifications made by the previous owner from whom I acquired it. The software is governed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3), which is dedicated to protecting the freedoms to use, study, modify, and share software.

#### Background

The decision to acquire and subsequently distribute this script was informed by the discovery that the original seller was engaging in the practice of reselling free software at a significant markup, with only minimal changes to the user interface. In response to this, and in keeping with the spirit and legal requirements of the GPLv3, I have taken the initiative to ensure that these modifications, along with the original script, are made freely available. This repository embodies a commitment to the open-source community's principles of transparency, collaboration, and the free distribution of software.

#### Repository Contents

Contained within this repository is the complete source code of the script as it was received by me, unaltered from its modified state. This includes both the original code and the modifications introduced by the previous owner.

#### Our Commitment to Open Source

By making this modified script accessible on GitHub, we are adhering to the stipulations set forth by the GPLv3, thus ensuring that everyone is granted the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software. This action is a reflection of our dedication to supporting the open-source ecosystem, fostering a culture of free knowledge exchange, and advancing technology in a manner that is inclusive and equitable.

#### Reason for Distribution

It is important to highlight that the catalyst for this distribution was the realization that the original seller was capitalizing on the open-source nature of the software by reselling it at a high price with only minimal user interface enhancements. This practice not only contravenes the ethos of the open-source movement but also undermines the fundamental rights afforded by the GPLv3. By making this software freely available, we aim to rectify this situation and ensure that the software remains accessible to all, in line with the original intentions of its licensing.

#### Access and Use

We invite all interested parties to explore, utilize, and contribute to this project. In accordance with the GPLv3, you are empowered to:

- **Run** the software for any purpose.
- **Study** the source code and modify it according to your needs.
- **Distribute** copies of the original or modified software, thus enabling others to benefit from the same freedoms.

#### Conclusion

This README stands as a declaration of our compliance with GPLv3 licensing requirements and our unwavering commitment to the principles of open-source software distribution. Through initiatives like this, we collectively contribute towards a technological future that is open, collaborative, and innovative.
